#Issues
1. Messages remain even when the user logs out as long as no reloading or closing of the page occurs. Though other users cannot see the messages of previously logged
in users, due to different conversation_ids, it is highly inefficient to the user's RAM. Find a way to rectify this.
2. Chat related services are provided in the ChatComponent due to complications when provided at ChatModule. This is highly inefficient as the Services are destroyed
whenever the component is destroyed and reinitialized whenever the Component is initialized. This happens when the the user navigates from AccountComponent and SearchComponent
To curb this, ensure ChatComponent is not destroyed between routes.
